- The story of this project is. I was at a City Hall meeting supporting the city
  where I lived and after the meeting they wanted to collect data for the city
  to make their own improvements for the community. <br><br> An idea came up,
  why not do something more Up-To-Date for my city other than paper and pencil.
  I spoke with the city Mayor and he was sold on it.

- That's the story of this project. If you read all of this, thank you for your
